\prefacesection{Acknowledgments}

First, I need to thank my supervisor, Dr. Ahmed Afsahi.
His mentorship and guidance throughout my masters have been invaluable, and the experience gained working with him will have a profound impact on my future. 
I also need to thank my colleagues in the Parallel Processing Research Lab, Yiltan Temucin, AmirHossein Sojoodi, Pedram Alizadeh, Amirreza Sedeh, and Hamed Sharifian.
Working with them often provided valuable insight and ideas while trying to solve challenging problems.

I would like to acknowledge the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering for their financial support.
I also need to thank the Vector Institute for awarding me the Vector Scholarship in AI. 
Nothing would have been possible without Compute Canada, as they provided key computing resources.
This thesis presents work done on Beluga, Narval, and Cedar, but Mist and Niagara were also critical in achieving these results. I should probably thank Zoom Video Communications, Inc. for their video conferencing software, as I would have been hopelessly lost without it during the depths of the covid lockdowns.

Lastly, I need to thank my family for their unconditional love and support. 
Gabriella and Michaela are wonderful sisters, Winnie is the best dog in the world, and my parents, Frances and Paul, who have been there for me every step of the way.
