    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Require Number of Processes $p$, physical topology distance matrix $D$
        \Ensure  Mapping array $M$ representing the new rank for each process
        \State Bind rank 0 to its current core
        \State Set rank 0 as the reference rank
        \While{There are processes to map}
            \State Select the target rank to map
            \State Find an unmapped core with the minimum distance to the reference core  
            \State Bind the target rank to the selected core
            \State Optionally update the reference core
